Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n\nMany data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n1. **Cleaner Code:** Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy.  With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.\n2. **Fewer Bugs:** There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n3. **Easier to Productionize:** It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale.  We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n4. **More Options for Model Validation:** You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n\n# Example\n\nAs in the previous tutorial, we will work with the [Melbourne Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot/home).  \n\nWe won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.
